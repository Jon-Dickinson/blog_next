# NextJS - Typescript - MDX - Blog

My personal site, made with Next.js. Built with:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- Write posts with [MDX](https://mdxjs.com/)
- Style with [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- Linting with [ESLint](https://eslint.org/)
- Formatting with [Prettier](https://prettier.io/)
- Testing with [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) and [`react-testing-library`](https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro)

This website was bootstrapped using this [starter](https://github.com/ChangoMan/nextjs-typescript-mdx-blog) by Hunter Chang, and was **heavily** inspired by [Lee Robinson](https://github.com/leerob/leerob.io) and [Anson Lichtfuss](https://github.com/ansonlichtfuss/website).
