Python is a very beginner-friendly language. However, it also has some more advanced features that can be hard to grasp. For me at least, decorators were one of them. I was seeing them here and there but never fully understood what they did and how they worked, even after reading a bunch of stuff about them. Until I came across the [talk 'So you want to be a Python expert' by James Powell](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cKPlPJyQrt4) in which he explains four key features of Python, including decorators. This article aims to put in writing the essence of the part of his talk about decorators.

Maybe you've not been in the Python ecosystem long enough to know what a decorator is, or you've encountered it but you didn't know what it was. A decorator is the little at-something on top of a function definition, like so:

```python
@dec
def func():
  pass
```

The best way to understand decorators is to understand what problem they solve. Bear with me, we'll get to decorators at the end and all will be clear.

### Setting up the problem

We are going to play with a mock example in order to understand the purpose of decorators.
Let's say you have a simple function that add stuff in a file called `dec.py`, with a default value for the second parameter of 10:

```python
# dec.py

def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y
```

Let's take a closer look at the `add` function itself:

```python
>>> add(10, 20)
30
>>> add
<function add at 0x7fce0da2fe18>
>>> add.__name__
'add'
>>> add.__module__
'__main__'
>>> add.__defaults__ # default value of the `add` function
(10,)
>>> add.__code__.co_varnames # the variable names of the `add` function
('x', 'y')
```

No need to understand what all of those are, the main thing to remember is that every function in python is a live thing that you can play with. You can also look at the source code for example, with the inspect module:

```python
>>> from inspect import getsource
>>> print(getsource(add))
def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y
```

Now let's say you use the `add` function in some way, for example you test it with a bunch of operations:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time

def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
```

Output: i

```python
add(10) 20
add(20, 30) 50
add("a", "b") ab
```

And let's say you want to time each of these operations, using the `time` module for example:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time


def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y

before = time()
print('add(10)',         add(10))
after = time()
print('time taken: ', after - before)
before = time()
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
after = time()
print('time taken: ', after - before)
before = time()
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
after = time()
print('time taken: ', after - before)
```

Output:

```python
add(10) 20
time taken:  6.699562072753906e-05
add(20, 30) 50
time taken:  6.9141387939453125e-06
add("a", "b") ab
time taken:  6.9141387939453125e-06
```

Now your programmer senses are itching because we are all taught to hate copy-paste, and for good reasons. It's not very readable, and if you want to change something you have to change it everywhere. There must be a better way.

We could do something like this instead, to capture the time directly in the `add` function:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time

def add(x, y=10):
  before = time()
  rv = x + y
  after = time()
  print('time taken: ', after - before)
  return rv

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
```

That would be definitely better than before. However if you have another function, this doesn't feel right anymore. And you could have many more functions:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time

def add(x, y=10):
  before = time()
  rv = x + y
  after = time()
  print('time taken: ', after - before)
  return rv

def sub(x, y=10):
  return x - y

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
print('sub(10)',         sub(10))
print('sub(20, 30)',     sub(20, 30))
```

Remember, both `add` and `sub` are functions. Let's take advantage of this and write a `timer` function. `timer` takes a function, times it while computing the output, and returns the outputs:

```python
def timer(func, x, y=10):
  before = time()
  rv = func(x, y)
  after = time()
  print('time taken: ', after - before)
  return rv
```

That's good, but we'll have to wrap everything with this `timer` function, like so:

```python
print('add(10)',         timer(add,10)))
```

And the default value is now `10`? Not pretty. How to do better?

Here's an idea: let's create a new `timer` function that wraps around other functions, and returns the wrapped function:

```python
def timer(func):
  def f(x, y=10):
    before = time()
    rv = func(x, y)
    after = time()
    print('time taken: ', after - before)
    return rv
  return f
```

Now you just need to wrap `add` and `sub` with `timer`, with:

```python
add = timer(add)
```

and it should work! Here's the full code:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time
def timer(func):
  def f(x, y=10):
    before = time()
    rv = func(x, y)
    after = time()
    print('time taken: ', after - before)
    return rv
  return f

def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y
add = timer(add)


def sub(x, y=10):
  return x - y
sub = timer(sub)

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
print('sub(10)',         sub(10))
print('sub(20, 30)',     sub(20, 30))
```

Output:

```python
time taken:  0.0
add(10) 20
time taken:  9.5367431640625e-07
add(20, 30) 50
time taken:  0.0
add("a", "b") ab
time taken:  9.5367431640625e-07
sub(10) 0
time taken:  9.5367431640625e-07
sub(20, 30) -10
```

So what did we do? We had a function (like `add`), and we wrapped it with a behavior (for example time it). We created a new function (`timer`), that takes the original function and wraps it with a bit of new behavior and returns the new function. Pretty useful eh?

Of course, there's still the issue of the default values. We'll tackle it a bit later.

## Decorators!

That pattern of wrapping functions with new, common behavior is exactly what decorators are. Instead of writing:

```python
def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y
add = timer(add)
```

You write:

```python
@timer
def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y
```

But it's **_exactly the same thing._** That's what a decorator is in Python. It's simply a syntax for saying `add = timer(add)`, but instead of putting it at the end of the function you put it at the top with the simpler syntax `@timer`.

Here's what the example would look like now:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time
def timer(func):
  def f(x, y=10):
    before = time()
    rv = func(x, y)
    after = time()
    print('time taken: ', after - before)
    return rv
  return f

@timer
def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y

@timer
def sub(x, y=10):
  return x - y

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
print('sub(10)',         sub(10))
print('sub(20, 30)',     sub(20, 30))
```

## args and kwargs

Now there's still one small detail left that isn't quite right. In the `timer` function, we hard-coded the parameters `x` and `y`, and even the default `y=10`. There's a way to pass the arguments and the key-word arguments for the function, with `*args` and `**kwargs`. To be clear, the arguments are the standard arguments of a function (in this case `x` is an argument), while the key-word arguments are the argument that already have a default value (like `y=10` here). Here's the code:

```python
# dec.py
from time import time
def timer(func):
  def f(*args, **kwargs):
    before = time()
    rv = func(*args, **kwargs)
    after = time()
    print('time taken: ', after - before)
    return rv
  return f

@timer
def add(x, y=10):
  return x + y

@timer
def sub(x, y=10):
  return x - y

print('add(10)',         add(10))
print('add(20, 30)',     add(20, 30))
print('add("a", "b")',   add("a", "b"))
print('sub(10)',         sub(10))
print('sub(20, 30)',     sub(20, 30))
```

Now the `timer` function works with any function, with any parameter and any set of defaults, because it just forwards the parameters to the function.

## Higher order decorators

Some of you may already wonder at this point: wait... If we can wrap one function inside a function to add useful behavior, could we go one step further? Could we wrap a function inside a function, inside another function?

Yes! In fact you can go as deep as you want (although usually you won't need to go any deeper than this). For example, let's say you want to write a decorator to execute a function `n` times. Here's what it would look like:

```python
def ntimes(n):
  def inner(f):
    def wrapper(*args, **kwargs):
      for _ in range(n):
        rv = f(*args, **kwargs)
      return rv
    return wrapper
  return inner
```

You can then wrap functions with this, for example with the earlier `add` function:

```python
@ntimes(3)
def add(x, y):
  print(x + y)
  return x + y
```

A `print` statement was added to show that the code indeed execute 3 times, otherwise the `@ntimes` wouldn't do a lot.

## Recap

So let recap what a decorator is:

- It's a function that wraps another function;
- It takes a function as a parameter;
- It returns a function;
- It's identical as putting `func = dec(func)` after the definition of `func`, but a more convenient method is putting `@dec` just above the definition of `func`.

I hope this has helped you to understand decorators in Python!
