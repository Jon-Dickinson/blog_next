This is my roadmap to go from an undergraduate CS and math background to a very good understanding of Machine Learning and Deep Learning concepts, and more importantly to successfully apply ML and DL. I will put here everything I've done (in italic), I'm doing (in bold), and I'm planning on doing (normal text) in order to reach that goal.

## Courses

1. [_Andrew Ng's Coursera Machine Learning course_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning)
2. _[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course part 1 v3_
3. _[Udacity Intro to deep learning with PyTorch](https://www.udacity.com/course/deep-learning-pytorch--ud188)_
4. _[fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) course part 2 v2_
5. (when it's out) [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) part 2 v3
6. [fast.ai](https://www.fast.ai/) machine learning course
7. **deeplearning.ai [Coursera Deep Learning Specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)**

## Personal projects

1. **Write a deep learning web app**
2. **Blog about deep learning, preferably about a technical subject (like a dive in fast.ai source code)**
3. **Contribute to the fast.ai library**
4. Take part in Kaggle competitions and reach top 10%
5. Freelance to gain real world experience in deep learning

## Books and blogs
